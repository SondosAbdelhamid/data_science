This project aims to analyze accident data to identify trends, understand contributing factors, and develop strategies for prevention.

The dataset used consists of accident reports, including information such as location, time, weather conditions, vehicle types, and injuries. The data is provided as a three files in CSV format.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Loading Data: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the pandas.read_csv() function.
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled. Outliers in numerical variables are identified and addressed. Removing non important colomns.
Feature Engineering: New features are created, such as day of month, month ,houe, and year, to enhance analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization: Use histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and geographic visualizations to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.
Key Findings:
Most accidents occur between age of 18 and 31.

Modeling is done Using DNN network and linear regression.

clustering using K-means
